# Deploy a simple hello world Lambda serverless function on AWS

## Introduction

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that allows you to run code for almost any type of application or backend service without the need for server provisioning or management.

This is super useful for developers, as they can focus on the development of product instead of manual task such as managing server.

## Prerequisite

Have a AWS Account


## Cost
Free - The AWS Lambda free tier includes one million free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

## Difficulty

Beginner

## Try yourself

Create a Lambda function using the console

### Step 1 - Go to the Lambda console

Create a function by going to the lambda console.

### Step 2 — Add function code

To create a function code, you have the following options: author from scratch, use a blueprint, container image and browse serverless app repository.

### Step 3 — Grant permission

Create an IAM role to grant the least privileged access to the lambda function.

### Step 4 - Optional settings

The last step is optional, where you can go into more advanced settings by adding triggers and destination to the function. This will determine where the lambda call can come from and where the results will be sent and processed.

## Next Steps

Deploy a Lambda function using CDK and CLI
